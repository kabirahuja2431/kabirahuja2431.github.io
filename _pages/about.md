My name is Kabir Ahuja, a 2019 graduate from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in 2019 with a major in Chemical Engineering.
I have a diverse set of Academic experiences ranging from Computational Chemistry to Natural Language Processing. Currently, I am
working as a Research Assistant at the Machine and Language Learning Lab under the supervision of Professor Partha Talukdar.
My current research involves around Syntax Guided Paraphrase Generation, where the task is to rephrase a sentence to retain it's
original meaning while conforming to a specified syntax. In the past, I have worked on developing Reinforcement Learning based optimizers for Geometry Optimization.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Machine Learning and Computational Chemistry. I am interested in exploring 
Model-based Reinforcement Learning methods for the autmatic discovery of Chemical species. On similar lines, I wish to explore
RL based methods for saddle point optimization in transition state search which is an important aspect of chemical reaction
discovery. On a slightly different note, I am also interested in developing methods for adversarially robust training of
different NLP models.

Beside my research, I enjoy watching movies and TV series. I try to review as many of them as I can and post it [here](https://www.picuki.com/profile/amoviebuffhufflepuff). Some of my
favourite films include: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Her, Inception and The Shinning. I also enjoy reading books, mostly fantasy. Some of my favourites are: His Dark Materials, Harry Potter (of course) and The Kingkiller Chronicles.
