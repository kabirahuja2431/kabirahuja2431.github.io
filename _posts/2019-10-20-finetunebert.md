These past 2 years have seen the rise of the ImageNet moment in NLP with the development of some impressive transfer learning approaches like ELMO, ULMFIT, OpenAI GPT, and BERT. These methods are pre-trained as language models on large amounts of unsupervised text corpora and are then utilized for various different downstream tasks in NLP like text classification, question answering, paraphrase detection, etc.
